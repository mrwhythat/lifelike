# Life-like Cellular Automaton

**lifelike** is an implementation of multirule cellular automaton
similar to [*Conway's Game of Life*][1]. It accepts common ruleset
representation, defaulting to "classic Life" *B3/S23*. While in terminal,
*space* can be used to pause/resume evolution.

## Usage
```
    -r, --ruleset RULES Ruleset (default: 'B3/S23')
    -h, --help          Show help menu
```
